# MTD Funnel Performance Dashboard

Live dashboard tracking month-to-date funnel performance across Close CRM — bookings, show-ups, qualified, closed-won, and revenue, broken down by funnel and utm_campaign.

**Live:** `stephenolivas.github.io/mtd-funnel-dashboard/`

## What It Tracks

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Booked | Qualifying meeting activities (same classification as Capacity Dashboard) |
| Showed | `First Call Show Up (Opp)` custom field on most-recent opportunity |
| Qualified | `Qualified (Opp)` custom field on most-recent opportunity |
| Closed Won | Opportunities with `status_type=won` and `date_won` in current month |
| Revenue | `value` field on closed-won opportunities |
| UTM Campaign | `utm_campaign` contact custom field (contact with most data wins) |

All rows deduplicated by `lead_id` — one lead = one booking count.  
Booked/Showed/Qualified share the same deduplicated meeting set.  
Closed Won is pulled **independently** by `date_won` to avoid attribution timing issues.

## Meeting Classification Rules (identical to Capacity Dashboard)

Meetings must survive ALL filters:

1. Calendar status: exclude `canceled` / `declined`
2. User exclusions: Stephen Olivas, Ahmad Bukhari, Kristin Nelson, Spencer Reynolds
3. Title classification (first-match-wins):
   - Starts with "Canceled" → exclude
   - Contains "Vending Quick Discovery" → exclude
   - Matches scraper "Next Steps" patterns → **include** *(checked before follow-up)*
   - Contains follow-up / F/U / Next Steps / reschedule → exclude
   - Contains "Anthony" + "Q&A" → exclude
   - Contains enrollment patterns → exclude
   - Matches standard first-call patterns → **include**
   - Default → exclude
4. Lead status: exclude `Canceled (by Lead)` and `Outside the US`
